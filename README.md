# water_movement

Water Movement app.

## Getting Started

The project is completed using dart and flutter plugins for android studio code and can be run on any mobile device or browser.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for the project came from Engineers Without Borders who provided the issue of limited internet access for operators in remote areas.

## What it does
The application provides a user interface to the current Water Movement website, where users can view posts, comments, and instructional videos on youtube.

## How we built it
The application was developed in Android Studio using the Flutter library.

## What we learned
At the start of the hackathon, all of the team members were unfamiliar with both Android Studio and Flutter. Throughout the course of the hackathon, all team members learned how to code in this new environment using online documentation.

## Challenges we ran into
Originally we had difficulties using the new development environment and setting up the base for the application. Even running a blank project on an emulated android phone took some learning.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Once we all became familiar with the environment we were able to create a complete UI using a language that we all learned in a short time frame.
